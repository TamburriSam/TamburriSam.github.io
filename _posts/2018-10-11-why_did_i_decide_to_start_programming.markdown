     I've always viewed programming as a type of logical magic. You create algorithms and poetic strings of numbers and letters and BOOM- you've created something beautiful. I view programming as a form of art. I've been interested since I was a kid. My father used to have this gigantic C++ book lying on the living room coffee table. I gazed with amusement every time he opened the book. I was enticed by the jumble-words I saw on the page and how he transformed this mishmash of what looks like nonsense into something innovative. (In fact, I made a website at only ten years old. It's very embarassing, but viewable here- www.samanthasrap.itgo.com).
		  From then on, I was hooked to anything tech-related. It started with the basics. I worked at a lounge when I was younger and my boss asked me to make and design a menu for our items. A customer came up to me and said "Hey, who made this menu? I love the design!" I told him I made it. To which he said "Cool, make me a website and I expect it by the end of the week". I gladly accepted. How hard could it be? Boy, was I surprised. I whipped something up on squarespace (it's all I could do!) that was passable (looking back, a bit laughable as well)- but not everything I wanted. After this, I looked into what it really takes to make a beautiful, responsive website. I taught myself HTML5 and CSS3 using Jon Duckett's manual. It was a great read and I learned a lot. 
			 After learning HTML and CSS, I decided I wanted to dip my feet even deeper into this seemingly never-ending world of coding. I wanted my website to respond to me. I wanted to learn about what went on behind the screen. I wished for complete control over the websites I was creating. Long story short, here I am. I'm interested and passionate about creating beautiful, responsive layouts both on the front-end and back-end side.
			 Let's see how this goes!
