   I guess I'd never thought I'd see the day where this all came together in my head. You hear about all of these different languages. Some control the "front-end" and some control the "back-end". This seems like nonsense at first. To be honest, it seemed like nonsense up until a few weeks ago. 
    I used to think of programming as this green matrix-screen of nonsensical keyboard characters. Now, I see it differently. Almost like a blooming tree. All these languages you hear about- work synergistically. The "back-end" being your seeds, your roots, the general foundation of the tree. The "front-end" being the visuals- the amount of branches, the color of the leaves, the thickness of the trunk.
